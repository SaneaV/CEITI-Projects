		<h1>
			Tom from a carton "Tom and Jerry"
		</h1>

		<p>
			Tom (named "<span class="original">Jasper</span>" in his debut appearance) is a grey and white mute domestic shorthair cat. ("<span class="original">Tom</span>" is a generic name for a male cat.) He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable, or even pampered life, while Jerry (named "<span class="original">Jinx</span>" in his debut appearance) is a small, brown mute, house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom. Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry's wits. Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size, approximately the equivalent of Tom's, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts. Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry, but only to hurt or compete with him as usual in a more intimidating strategy to just taunt Jerry (even as revenge), and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry. <span class="byTheFinal">By the final "fade-out" of each cartoon, Jerry usually gets the best of Tom</span>.
