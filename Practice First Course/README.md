30. Baccalaureate. Information on the success of n candidates for the baccalaureate session is stored in two text files:
- the BAC.txt file, each line of which corresponds to a single candidate and each other. A line in the file contains the following data, separated by a space: CodC (Candidate Code); C Name (Candidate Name); PrenE (Candidate's First Name); DenInst (Name of the institution where he studies); Profile (Profile); The names of four subjects (D1, D2, D3, D4) and the marks obtained in the respective examinations: Note 1, Note 2, Note 3, Note 4,
- the file Contest.txt, each line of which corresponds to a single candidate, who contested the marks in certain disciplines. A line in the file contains the following data, separated by a space: CodC (Candidate Code); The names of the disciplines from the set (D1, D2, D3, D4) and the respective marks from the set (Note 1, Note 2, Note 3, Note 4), obtained following the contestation;
Develop a program that, using menus and subprograms, performs, at the user's request, the following prescriptions:
1) registers a new candidate;
2) Delete from the input files the lines corresponding to the candidate with the name and surname entered from the keyboard;
3) Displays on the screen the list of candidates, in alphabetical order by name and surname, for the profile entered from the keyboard;

6) Displays on the screen the list of candidates with the maximum number of insufficient marks obtained in the BAC session;
7) Determines the average grade obtained by all students of the institution indicated on the keyboard, at all exams;
